<p>Agile is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though its not complete</p>

                                                  <h2><p>What agile software development is?</p></h2>
<p>Agile is a collaborative system placed forward that teams can use to make decisions on how to work around software development the 12 principles, software development requirements & solutions evolve through collaboration. This can be  peer reviewed by others to deliver faster & more efficient work.</p>

        <p>1. Deliver ustomer satisfaction by delivering valuable software continuously</p>
        <p>2. Always accept change of requirements matter how early or late in the project</p>
        <p>3. Deliver software that works within a shorter timescale</p>
        <p>4. Both developers and business professionals must work closely together daily throughout the project</p>
        <p>5. Information is best transferred between parties in face-to-face conversations</p>
        <p>6. Motivate people to build a project by creating an environment of appreciation, trust, and empowerment</p>
        <p>7. Working software is the key measure of progress</p>
        <img src="https://hackernoon.com/drafts/6t8232hs.png"/>
        <p>8. The agile process promotes sustainable development</p>
        <p>9. Continuous attention to excellence and quality in technical development and design boosts the agility</p>
        <p>10. Simplicity is a vital part of effective agile management</p>
        <p>11. Self-organized teams produce the best architecture, requirements, and design</p>
        <p>12. Teams should reflect through inspection and adaption to be more effective </p>

<p>In conclusion, Agile less dominance equals to more thriving projects, so using Agile will reduce you fails by 9% compared to other non agile softwares, therefore increase predictability, save money, boots time to market and minimise fails. Agile therefore, decreases uncertainty,  increases productivity, increase quality, and lastly builds team moral.</p>

                                                            <h2 id="scrum"><p>SCRUM</p></h2>

                                                          <h3 id="what"><p>What is SCRUM?</p></h3>
<p>Defintion: Scrum is a process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work.  Scrum is empirical in that it provides a means for teams to establish a hypothesis of how they think something works, try it out, reflect on the experience, and make the appropriate adjustments.  That is, when the framework is used properly.
Scrum is structured in a way that allows teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks where they make sense for the team’s context</p>

                                                            <h3 id="Increment"><p>Increment</p></h3>
<p>This is inspectable and empiricism, is a step towards a vision or goal. If the product owner owns the decision as to whether or not to release a piece of code, or indeed whether or not to publish an episode, then the development teams definition of done should stop short of that point, of that decision.
Why? Well, because the development team should be able to achieve its definition of done without any input from the product owner. I focused so much on the end of that sentence that I almost forgot to talk about the beginning. The increment must be in a usable condition. So the firm condition here is not that it's released, but that it is releasable.</p>

<img src="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/scrum/what-are-scrum-ceremonies/sites/7/2018/11/the-agile-scrum-framework.png"/>                                                            
                                                            <h3 id="sprint"><p>The Sprint</p></h3>
<p>Each sprint may be considered a project with no more than one month horizon, like projects sprint are used to accomplish something, each sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it,  the work, and the resultant product increment.
Each sprint goes through the waterfall stage design, build, test and release and repeats per sprint cycle.</p>
<p>What about release? Scrum does not require a release, but every sprint to build termed a potentially releasable increment.
There’s nothing in the scrum guide were have to wait till the end before releasing it has continuous integration and continuous deployment.</p>  
<p>The benefits to scrum is that, it reduces risk, so if you run of wrong direction at least you did so in less than a month or few weeks and rather than build up of years.
At the end of each sprint, we inspect and adapt, which is built in another scrum event the sprint review.</p>

                                                            <h3 id="planning"><p>Sprint planning</p></h3>
<p>"No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal." Of course, it's quite normal for the team itself, to make changes as it moves through the Sprint, and discovers new things about the work, and the Scrum Guide words this rather nicely, "Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between, the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned."</p>

<p>So this chunking of time into the Sprint, brings with it some really good stuff a reduction of risk, the improvement of the product over time, and the improvement of processes over time. We get better at playing the game.
What's not to like? Well, not much, but these things don't come for free.</p>
<img src="https://www.techagilist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sprint-Planning-1280x720.png" />
<p >Team needs to figure out what's achievable within each Sprint. So they need to spend time sizing, estimating, backlog items, so they know how many of them can fit into the Sprint. That's an overhead that you won't find, in all agile frameworks And what happens if the team gets the estimates wrong?
We have a tendency towards optimism, so it's not unusual for the team to approach the end of the Sprint and see that there's still rather a lot to be done. Is it okay just to stretch the Sprint just a little bit in order to fit them in?</p>
<p>Well, no it's not. We never increase the size of the Sprint. However, if things get really hairy, we do have the option, of canceling the Sprint.</p>
<p> What the Scrum Guide says about that: "A Sprint would be canceled "if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.</p> 
<p>"This might occur if the company changes direction" or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled , if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances". Dramatic stuff indeed but, given that a Sprint is only a few weeks long anyway, Sprint cancellation is rare.</p>

                                                            <h3 id="backlog"><p>Sprint Backlog:</p></h3>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is a list of things that the development team will work on during the Sprint, it's created once per Sprint and the event where it's created is the Sprint Planning Meeting. The Product Backlog, the master list of things to do, provides the input. I think I'm on safe ground so far, let's just check in with the Scrum Guide. The Spring Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint. So far so good. Two properties of the Product Backlog and its contents are useful slash relevant when it comes to selecting items.
It's a prioritized list with the most important items appearing towards the top, and the items, if not all of them, but certainly those towards the top of the list are sized. I'm going to represent the relative size like this. It's common practice to size using story points. Although you won't find a mention of story points in the Scrum Guide. And if the team has a few Sprints under its belt it will have an idea of its Capacity, in other words the number of story points it can handle, it can process during one Sprint.</p>

<p>A prioritized list of sized things to do and a capacity? Could it be that creating a Sprint Backlog is as simple as taking items from the top of the Product Backlog until the number of story points is equal to the Capacity? Perhaps with a bit of jiggling around at the end to fill the space. If it was as simple as that there'd be a button to do it in Jira.
There's not a button for that. Is there a button for that in Jira? Not a clue. Let's take half a step back here, it's the Development. Team's job to, by the end of the Sprint, produce an Increment, to give it its Sunday name, a potentially, I never say that right, to produce a Potentially Releasable Increment. So it makes sense as far as it's possible, to select items from the Product Backlog that are complementary, coherent, or pulling in a similar direction.</p>

<p>Pulling towards a Sprint Goal. The Scrum Guide ties these things together quite nicely. The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
One thing to note that it is the Development Team and the Development Team alone that selects items for the Sprint Backlog. Yes the other members of the team have an influence but the final say goes to the Development Team. And there's another important point concerning adding work to the Sprint Backlog during the course of the Sprint. So what do you reckon? Is it okay to add work to the Sprint Backlog during a Sprint?</p>

<p>Sprint Backlog during the course of the Sprint, well the answer is no and it's yes. The Sprint Backlog is Scrum's way of limiting work in progress, and limiting work in progress is important for getting things done and getting thing done quickly with a minimum of context switching. So when Sprint Planning is over, the Sprint Backlog is locked down. Any attempt by anyone outside the Development Team to add new work into the
Sprint Backlog should be vigorously resisted, in fact it's one of the Scrum Master's key roles to protect the Sprint Backlog from external influence.</p> 
<p>But that's not to say that the Sprint Backlog is fixed, agile development is a process of discovery, and it's not uncommon for new work to be uncovered during the course of the Sprint, new work that is required in order to produce a Potentially Releasable Increment. Hey I said it that time. The Scrum Guide puts it like this, the Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.
The emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal. In short, work can be added to the Sprint Backlog but only by the Development Team.</p>

                                                          <h3 id="product"><p>Product backlog:</p></h3>
<p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. The words of the Scrum Guide And, the Scrum Guide goes on to devote a fair few column inches to the Product Backlog.
The Product Backlog is one of the three Scrum Artifactsalong with the Sprint Backlog and the Increment. You'll find episodes on both of those, and many other aspects of Scrum, at this link, and this is probably also a good time to remind you that there is a cheat sheet to go along with this series.</p>
<p>The Product Backlog sits here outside of the Sprint Loop, but a key input to it. Without the Product Backlog, there'd be nothing to plan in Sprint Planning, and there'd be nothing to put in the Sprint Backlog. If I zoom out further to the overall Agile flow, we see that the Product Backlog is a vessel,  a collection point for feedback received from the customer, as well as from stakeholders, and from the development team.</p>
<p>As we covered in the first episode of this series, this flow is not unique to Scrum, nor is the Product Backlog a construct that is unique to Scrum. It's common to all of the Agile frameworks that I'm aware of.
There's a very well-defined way of getting items out of the Product Backlog. That's the ritual, the event, that we call Sprint Planning, The point where items are taken from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog. Getting items into the Product Backlog is a little less well-defined, but at least there's one thing that is defined about the Product Backlog and that is it has a very specific owner, the Product Owner.</p>
<img src="https://www.scrumdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/product-backlog-item-types.jpg" />

<p>Let's jump inside the Product Backlog. It's just to help you keep track of them as they move around, and move around they will. The Product Backlog is in a constant state of flux. The Product Owner's job is to maximize the value. of the product over time, and she does that by making sure that the most important items in this list appear towards the top.
Most important, is that right? I've been saying that the most important items appear towards the top of the Backlog for so long that I've maybe lost track that that's not exactly right.</p>

<p>Maybe it's the most valuable items that appear towards the top. Well, that's better, but there's still the problem that a high value item often depends on a lower value item, and, in this list, the lower value item would therefore be pushed up for earlier development. I'm beginning to see why the Scrum Guide says that the list is prioritized and leaves it at that. So, prioritized, certainly, but priorities change. What was important or valuable, or something else, yesterday may not be so today. And, new items arrive all the time and can be slotted in at, well, at almost any point, even towards the top of the list if the item merits it and if it is sufficiently refined.
Refined? When an item arrives in the list it might be nebulous, fuzzy, a little rough around the edges, which is fine for low, even for mid-range items, but if it's going to reach the top echelons, it's going need sharpening up a bits. This sharpening up falls under the general umbrella of Backlog refinement.</p>
<p>Here's the Scrum Guide again.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of the Product Backlog items.
Finally, a little bit of help for the Product Owner. Let's just check that we've got this refinement thing covered.</p> 
<p>Back to the Scrum Guide once more. Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to the items in the Product Backlog. Oh no, estimates, more work to do, work that's not required for every Agile framework, but is required for Scrum. If an item is going to reach the top echelons of a Scrum Product Backlog,
I'm afraid it is going to have to be sized.</p> 
<p>Why? Simply because during Sprint Planning we're going to be selecting a Sprints worth of work, and we're gonna be doing that based on the size of the items selected. So far I've talked about Product Backlog items without actually saying what constitutes an item, and I'm gonna go back to the Scrum Guide one last time for a ruling on this.
 we go.</p> 
<p>The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements  and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future.</p> <p>I'm curious, is that a list that you agree with or would you suggest amendments? Let me know in the comments below. And, get ready to comment on what I'm about to tell you to think. I'm about to stray into controversial waters. 
Zooming out a little bit to look at the Product Backlog as a whole, the items towards the top of this list we now know are ordered, they're detailed, and we have estimates from them. Being in a well-refined state is a consequence and a condition of their elevated status. As for the remaining items in the list, they may or may not be well-refined, depending upon their history.</p> 
<p>But, and here's the point, while these items in the mid-range are targets for Backlog refinement, the items towards the bottom of the list are not.
As far as Backlog refinement is concerned, these items should be ignored. Why? Well, chances are that this item will never move up the list, that it will never be developed. And, that is the case, why waste time on it? Should the item rise up the list  at some point in the future, and of course I do wish it all the best, then it will find itself in the mid-range and become subject to refinement. But, until it does, it should be ignored.</p>
 
                                                         <h3 id="review"><p>Sprint review:</p></h3>
<p>This ensures, the product reviews and improves over time, so get to play the game sprint after sprint after sprint ect, this gives us the opportunity to get better at playing the game. 
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and from making decisions based on what is known.</p> 
<p> Scrum guide goes on to talk about the three pillars of empirical process control.</p>
<p>Transparency, inspection and adaptation,and the Sprint Review is all about those last two pillars, at the end of each Sprint we inspect and we adapt, but what do we inspect and what gets adapted?</p>
<p> Scrum guide is rather explicit about the elements that go into a proper Sprint Review. I count seven bullet points and only one of those is the demo, now really this should come as no surprise, in the same way that the daily Scrum isn't just an update, the Sprint Review isn't just a demo.</p>
<p><img src="https://startinfinity.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/t/seLlg2lgmskxNDobnJ5kVvyy0YwukAenpsSd6bzM.png"/></p>


<p>Remember where we came in, empiricism and those three pillars,</p>
Daily stand up, that's just a series of updates, may tick the box of inspection,  but there's no adaptation. And similarly a Sprint Review that's only a demo, again there's inspection maybe, but adaptation, not at all. So if we're doing a Sprint Review something must change, adapt, or it's really been a big waste of everyone's time. 
<p>With that said let's go back to that list, of seven bullet points from the Scrum guide.</p>
    <p>1.The product owner explains what product backlog items have been done and what has not been done.</p>
    <p>2.The development team discussed,  what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into and how those problems were solved. But we slightly overlapping with the retrospective.</p>
    <p>3.The development team demonstrates the work, that it has done and answers questions about the increment. Excellent the demo is in the list, good to know.</p>
    <p>4.The product owner discusses the product backlog as it stands, he or she projects lightly target and delivery date based on progress to date, open brackets if needed.</p>
    <p>5.The entire group collaborates, on what to do next so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.</p>
    <p>6.Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed, what is the most valuable thing to do next.</p>
    <p>7.This one is a bit of a mouthful, review of the timeline, budget potential capabilities and marketplace, for the next anticipated releases of functionality, or capability of the product.</ul></p>

                                            <h3 id="master"><p>Scrum Master Responsibilities</p></h3>
<p>Indeed, we find scrum masters often perform some or all of the following, not all of which are defined by scrum:</p>

    <p>1.Facilitate daily standups (or the daily scrum) as needed.</p>
    <p>2.Iteration/sprint planning meetings protect the team from over-committing and scope creep. Aid in estimation and sub task creation.</p>
    <p>3.Sprint reviews participate in the meeting and capture feedback.</p>
    <p>4.Retrospectives note areas for improvement and action items for future sprints.</p>
    <p>5.Board administration, work as the administrator of the scrum board. Ensure that cards are up to date and the scrum tool, Jira software or otherwise, is working well.</p>
    <p>6.1 on 1s meet individually with team members and stakeholders as needed. Iron out team disagreements about process and work styles. While many scrum practitioners are anti-1on1, as they believe these communications should happen during standups, some teams, particularly for new teams, prefer to have these regular face-to-face interactions with specific team members. The scrum master may decide that these individual interactions are crucial for team development and getting to know one another.</p>
    <p>7.Internal Consulting, scrum masters should be prepared to consult with team members and internal stakeholders on how best to work with the scrum team.</p>
    <p>8.Reporting regular analysis of burndown charts and other portfolio planning tools to understand what gets built and at what cadence.</p>
    <p>9.Blockers, the scrum master aids the team by eliminating external blockers and managing internal roadblocks through process or workflow improvements.</p>
    <p>10.Busy work if the scrum team isn’t humming, that’s the scrum master’s problem. Maybe that means fixing broken computers, moving desks around, or even adjusting the thermostat. Scrum masters should be comfortable doing just about anything to help their team and should be not slink away from grabbing coffees or some snacks if that’s what the team really needs.</p></ul>

<p>This is like a user story, we don’t know how were going to deliver this and time box a time next sprint in how we are going to delivery this, so whoever in charge of spike will need to figure out how they will do this "Sometimes a story is too large or overly complex. Perhaps the implementation or a 3rd party tool or library is poorly understood. The team can’t estimate the story. Perhaps we’re unsure if we’ll be able to complete the story due to some potential blocker.
User story the task e.g. putting in break out rooms
<p>Size story relevant to other story one doing it in fiminachi sequence so one point relative to others</p>

                                                <h3 id="retro"><p>Sprint retro:</p></h3>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective is the last of Scrum's five events. And, if sprint (bubble popping) planning marks the beginning of a Sprint,
then the Sprint Retrospective (bubble popping), marks its end. It is, as the Scrum Guide reminds us, an opportunity for the team to inspect itself.</p>
<p>In the Sprint Review, we inspect and adapt the increment with the aim of improving the quality of the product over time. In the Sprint Retrospective, we inspect and adapt, well, pretty much everything else. One of the cool things about Scrum is, that, every two weeks, the clock re-starts, and we get to play the game again. And this gives us the opportunity to get better at playing the game. And Scrum doesn't leave this to chance. The Scrum Guide is very specific about the purpose of the Retrospective. It lists these three points
<p>"Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools." Like I said, everything, but the product.</p>
"Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements."</p>
<p>"Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work." Create a plan. That's the "adapt" part of "inspect and adapt". Talking's great, but what we need is to take action.</p>

<p>Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint."</p> 
<p>The next Sprint? So soon?</p>
<p>"Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation."</p>
<p>What do we know so far? Well, that the Sprint Retrospective is a meeting; A meeting that happens at the end of each Sprint. Who attends? The Scrum Team, and, in this case, only the Scrum Team. Think self-organizing team. How is the meeting run? Well, the Scrum Guide says... nothing, at all, about how it should be run. 
And reminder, if one were needed, that Scrum is not a methodology, it is a framework.</p>
<p>So, it's up to us, or rather, up to the Scrum Team to choose its own method, or, indeed, to pick and mix from a number of different methods. 
One common, approach is the start, stop, and continue method.</p> 
<p>Very briefly, each member of the team grabs some, Post-Its and a Sharpie and jots down thoughts, from the current Sprint, under the general, headings of things that the team should start, to do, that the team should stop doing, and the, things that, they think, the team should continue to do. They do this individually, at first, before moving the Post-Its on to a white board to talk through each of the items to try to identify common themes and to come up with some action items.</p>

                                                <h3 id="conclusion"><p>In conclusion</p></h3>
<p>SCRUM provides a more efficent, fast, prodcutive management comapred to AGILE, and this is because SCRUM non-hierarchical structure and discipline everyone regardless of position in the company  or process of the product.  
AGILE is mainly aimed at for those in the gaming industry whereas SCRUM is for more commerical context.</p>

                                                    <h3><p>Kanban Definition</p></h3>
<p>Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.</p>
                                                    <h3><p>Kanban systems</p></h3>
<p>A Kanban system ideally controls the entire value chain from the supplier to the end consumer. In this way, it helps avoid supply disruption and overstocking of goods at various stages of the manufacturing process. Kanban requires continuous monitoring of the process. Particular attention needs to be given to avoid bottlenecks that could slow down the production process. The aim is to achieve higher throughput with lower delivery lead times. Over time, Kanban has become an efficient way in a variety of production systems.</p>

                                                <h3 id="kpp"><p>Kanban Principles & Practices</p></h3>
<p>The Kanban Method follows a set of principles and practices for managing and improving the flow of work. It is an evolutionary, non-disruptive method that promotes gradual improvements to an organization’s processes. If you follow these principles and practices, you will successfully be able to use Kanban for maximizing the benefits to your business process – improve flow, reduce cycle time, increase value to the customer, with greater predictability – all of which are crucial to any business today.</p>
<img src="https://d30s2hykpf82zu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Simple-Kanban-Board.png" />
<p>Foundational Principles</p>
<p>1.Start with what you are doing now: The Kanban Method (hereafter referred to as just Kanban) strongly emphasizes not making any change to your existing setup/ process right away. Kanban must be applied directly to current workflow. Any changes needed can occur gradually over a period of time at a pace the team is comfortable with.</p>
<p>2.Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change: Kanban encourages you to make small incremental changes rather than making radical changes that might lead to resistance within the team and organization.</p>
<p>3.Initially, respect current roles, responsibilities and job-titles: Unlike other methods, Kanban does not impose any organizational changes by itself. So, it is not necessary to make changes to your existing roles and functions which may be performing well. The team will collaboratively identify and implement any changes needed. These three principles help the organizations overcome the typical emotional resistance and the fear of change that usually accompany any change initiatives in an organization.</p>
<p>4.Encourage acts of leadership at all levels: Kanban encourages continuous improvement at all the levels of the organization and it says that leadership acts don’t have to originate from senior managers only. People at all levels can provide ideas and show leadership to implement changes to continually improve the way they deliver their products and services.</p>
                                                    <h3 id="sixcore"><p>6 core practices of Kanban:</p></h3>
<p>*Visualize the flow of work: This is the fundamental first step to adopting and implementing the Kanban Method. You need to visualize – either on a physical board or an electronic Kanban Board, the process steps that you currently use to deliver your work or your services. Depending on the complexity of your process and your work-mix (the different types of work items that you work on and deliver), your Kanban board can be very simple to very elaborate. Once you visualize your process, then you can visualize the current work that you and your team are doing.
This can be in the form of stickies or cards with different colors to signify either different classes of service or could be simply the different type of work items. (In SwiftKanban, the colors signify the different work item types!)If you think it may be useful, your Kanban board can have different Swim Lanes, one for each class of service or for each work item type. However, initially, to keep things simple, you could also just have a single swimlane to manage all your work – and do any board redesign later.</p>
<img src="https://d30s2hykpf82zu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kanban-for-Lean-Agile-Teams.png" />
<p>*Limit WIP (Work in Progress): Limiting work-in-progress (WIP) is fundamental to implementing Kanban – a ‘Pull-system’. By limiting WIP, you encourage your team to complete work at hand first before taking up new work. Thus, work currently in progress must be completed and marked done. This creates capacity in the system, so new work can be pulled in by the team. Initially, it may not be easy to decide what your WIP limits should be. In fact, you may start with no WIP limits. The great Don Reinertsen suggests (he did so at one of the Lean Kanban conferences) that you can start with no WIP limits and simply observe the initial work in progress as your team starts to use Kanban. Once you have sufficient data, define WIP limits for each stage of the workflow (each column of your Kanban board) as being equal to half the average WIP.</p>
<p>Typically, many teams start with a WIP Limit of 1 to 1.5 times the number of people working in a specific stage. Limiting WIP and putting the WIP limits on each column of the board not only helps the team members first finish what they are doing before taking up new stuff – but also communicates to the customer and other stakeholders that there is limited capacity to do work for any team – and they need to plan carefully what work they ask the team to do.</p>
<img src="https://d30s2hykpf82zu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Kanban-Board-Todo-Doing-Done.png" />
<p>*Manage Flow: Managing and improving flow is the crux of your Kanban system after you have implemented the first 2 practices. A Kanban system helps you manage flow by highlighting the various stages of the workflow and the status of work in each stage. Depending on how well the workflow is defined and WIP Limits are set, you will observe either a smooth flow within WIP limits or work piling up as something gets held up and starts to hold up capacity. All of this affects how quickly work traverses from start to the end of the workflow (some people call it value stream). Kanban helps your team analyze the system and make adjustments to improve flow so as to reduce the time it takes to complete each piece of work.</p>
<img src="https://d30s2hykpf82zu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CFD-Cycle-Time-Distribution-Throughput.png" />

<p>A key aspect of this process of observing your work and resolving/ eliminating bottlenecks is to look at the intermediate wait stages (the intermediate Done stages) and see how long work items stay in these “handoff stages”. As you will learn, reducing the time spent in these wait stages is key to reducing Cycle Time. As you improve flow, your team’s delivery of work becomes smoother and more predictable. As it becomes more predictable, it becomes easier for you to make reliable commitments to your customer about when you will get done with any work you are doing for them. Improving your ability to forecast completion times reliably is a big part of implementing a Kanban system!</p>
<p>*Make Process Policies Explicit: As part of visualizing your process, it makes sense to also define and visualize explicitly, your policies (process rules or guidelines) for how you do the work you do. By formulating explicit process guidelines, you create a common basis for all participants to understand how to do any type of work in the system. The policies can be at the board level, at a swim lane level and for each column.They can be a checklist of steps to be done for each work item-type, entry-exit criteria for each column, or anything at all that helps team members manage the flow of work on the board well. Examples of explicit policies include the definition of when a task is completed, the description of individual lanes or columns, who pulls when, etc. The policies must be defined explicitly and visualized usually on the top of the board and on each lane and column.</p>
<img src="https://d30s2hykpf82zu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Explicit-Policies-in-Kanban-Board-1024x613.png" />
<p>Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (using the scientific method): The Kanban Method is an evolutionary improvement process. It helps you adopt small changes and improve gradually at a pace and size that your team can handle easily. It encourages the use of the scientific method – you form a hypothesis, you test it and you make changes depending on the outcome of your test. As a team implementing Lean/ Agile principles, your key task is to evaluate your process constantly and improve continuously as needed and as possible.</p>
<p>The impact of each change that you make can be observed and measured using the various signals your Kanban system provides you. Using these signals, you can evaluate whether a change is helping you improve or not, and decide whether to keep it or try something else. Kanban systems help you collect a lot of your system’s performance data – either manually, if you use a physical board, or automatically, if you use a tool such as SwiftKanban. Using this data, and the metrics it helps you generate, you can easily evaluate whether your performance is improving or dropping – and tweak your system as needed.</p>
